for microservice creation :

docker:

build image: docker build -t employeepoc .(this . will be for docker file if we are running from same place where docker file is then only . will work or else complete path after .)
run docker image: docker run -p 8080:9090 employeepoc:latest (8080 would be the port from docker file)---> then check from system ip : 9090
docker hub credential : nikumari, Gudiya@2024

push image to docker hub: docker tag employeepoc:latest nikumari/employeepoc:latest (nikumari is username in docker hub)
                          docker image push nikumari/employeepoc:latest
    use same name in deployment file
