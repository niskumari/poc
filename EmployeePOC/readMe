for docker and microservice : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3YERpG2rMs
for microservice creation :

docker:

build image: docker build -t employeepoc .(this . will be for docker file if we are running from same place where docker file is then only . will work or else complete path after .)
run docker image: docker run -p 8080:9090 employeepoc:latest (8080 would be the port from docker file)---> then check from system ip : 9090


push image to docker hub: docker tag employeepoc:latest nikumari/employeepoc:latest (nikumari is username in docker hub)
                          docker image push nikumari/employeepoc:latest
    use same name in deployment file
kubenet commands:
kubectl apply -f <<deploymentFile>>
kubectl apply -f <<service.yaml>>

After changing type to LoadBalancer to clusterIP in service...need to run "minikube service <<service-name>> " to assign external ip to services and run from post man

    "PersonID": "123",
